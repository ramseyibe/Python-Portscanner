# Python-Portscanner
Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanner written in Python. It can be used to scan a target host for open ports.
Usage

To use the port scanner, you will need to provide the target host and the target ports. You can do this by passing the -H and -p options to the program.

For example, to scan the host 192.168.1.1 for the ports 80, 443, and 22, you would use the following command:

python port_scanner.py -H 192.168.1.1 -p 80,443,22
Output

The port scanner will output a list of all the open ports on the target host. The output will be color-coded, with open ports shown in green and closed ports shown in red.
