# Python-Portscanner
Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanner written in Python. It can be used to scan a target host for open ports and returns the version of the open ports.
Usage

To use the port scanner, you will need to provide the target host and the target ports. You can do this by passing the -H and -p options to the program.

For example, to scan the host 192.168.1.1 for the ports 80, 443, and 22, you would use the following command:

python3 advancescanner.py -H 192.168.1.1 -p 80,443,22
Output

The port scanner will output a list of all the open ports on the target host. The output will be color-coded, with open ports shown in green and closed ports shown in red.
